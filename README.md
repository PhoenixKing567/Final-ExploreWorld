# ExploreWorld Unity Game

This game was created using the Unity Game Engine, and involves controlling a car through challenging terrain in order to reach the plane. When creating this game, real world physics that I learned in Grade 11 and 12 was taken into consideration and different principles such as gravity, acceleration, mass, and forces were applied when programming the car to move at the player's command. The player uses arrow keys to navigate through hills and depressions as the different principles stated above influence each other to control the velocity and direction of the car. 

Overall, this project is a world exploration game that includes real world physics to control objects such as vehicles in a fun and interesting way.
